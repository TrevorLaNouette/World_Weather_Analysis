# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
After creating the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers made a few suggested changes they would like to see implemented. Specifically, they recommend adding 4 things:

- 1) the weather description to the weather data. 
- 2) Create input statements to filter the data for users weather preferences


- 3) Use the information to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. (We picked 4 of these locations by hotel name)

- 4) Using the Google Maps Directions API, create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
